# Project 1 # Interpret a Data Visualization


# Project Description

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.
Madrid in Detail was a very intersting dashboard. I explain the Population density in Central & Outskirts of the City, Births, Deaths, and foreigners. finally I discussed The highest age ratio of the population .


# Feedback

This is a great first project and an excellent start to your Nanodegree! 
I left you comments below and a couple of suggestions for improvement in the report.

Congratulations and all the best for the rest of your data journey!

# Project 2 # Analyze NYSE Data



# Project Description 

In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.
I complete my own data analysis and create a presentation to share my findings, develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement and create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.

# Project 4 # Build Data Dashboards




# Project Description 

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
